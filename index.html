  <article>
    <h2 id="what_is_web_designing">What is Web Designing?</h2>
    <p>Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience.User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.</p>

    <!--What Do Web Designers Do?-->
    <article>
        <h2 id="what_do_web_designers_do">What Do Web Designers Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Web designers create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.
        </p>
       <p>
        Visitors rate their experience with a specific website based on its aesthetics and how intuitive it is in terms of navigation. Therefore, web designers use Adobe, CorelDraw, Inkscape, and other design programs to create animations, graphics, icons, logos, and other elements of a website to make it as interactive as possible. Web designers also focus on the creative and visual side of the website and follow various design practices, such as symmetry, color systems, proportions, etc. to engage visitors. Additionally, they work on fonts, placement of images and videos, and creating layouts using coding languages.

  <!--Key Benefits of Having a Good Web Design-->
  <article>
    <h2 id="key_benefits_of_having_a_good_web_design">Key Benefits of Having a Good Web Design</h2>
    <p>A good web design can transform how your brand speaks to your audience. Organizations focus on their web design more than ever and look for professional web designers for the apparent benefits it can offer. Some of these benefits include:</p>

    <h3>An Impactful First Impression</h3>
    <p>With a well-designed website, it becomes easier to make a grand first impression. For brands, it is all about how potential customers or clients view their business, and this is greatly influenced by how they view their website. Your website represents your brand, and when you focus on web designing, it can help you create a compelling and powerful first impression.

    <h3>Better Google Rankings</h3>
    <p>Web designing has a variety of elements that are capable of bestowing your website with better Google rankings. Some of these elements include readability, mobile-friendliness, website speed, sitemaps, URL structure, and website navigation. A good web design has these elements incorporated into the website, which gives you greater visibility both for your audience and the search engine.</p>

    <h3>Brand Consistency</h3>
    <p>Several key assets of your brand, such as the logo, color scheme, and fonts can ensure your audience remembers your brand and easily differentiates it from thousands of others. A professional web designer takes into account all the unique aspects of your business and blends them into your website to add to your brand credibility and portray consistency.</p>

    <h3>Minimized Bounce Rates</h3>
    <p>When your website is immersive and interesting, it encourages visitors to go deeper and explore different sections of the website. Likewise, a website that is seemingly complicated and difficult to navigate can prompt visitors to exit it within seconds. Bounce rates also impact the credibility and rankings of your website. When your website is designed to retain visitors for longer, you can escape premature exits and minimize bounce rates.</p>

 <!--Key Elements of Web Designn-->
 <article>
    <h2 id="key_elements_of_web_design">Key Elements of Web Design</h2>
    <p>AA good website is one that displays a careful balance between appearance and functionality. When your website is aesthetically pleasing but fails to offer the information or help your audience with what it looks for, the aesthetics cannot make up for the lack of functionality and vice versa. Therefore, web design comprises two broad key elements—aesthetic or visual elements and functional elements—that are of equal importance to make your website stand out.</p>


        <h3>Visual Elements</h3>
        <p>Visual elements come together and set a theme for your website, which leaves a great impact on visitors when you get it right. It is crucial that every element compliments one another and looks harmonious rather than chaotic. Visual elements include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Fonts</li>
        <li>Colors</li>
        <li>Shapes</li>
        <li>Layout</li>
        <li>Icons</li>
        <li>Logos</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Video</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="web_design_vs_web_development">Web Design Vs. Web Development</h2>

    <p>Web design and web development are two terms that are often used interchangeably. However, they both mean two different things, have different purposes, and require a different set of skills to be implemented on a website. Web design is more about the experiential side of a website that ensures the audience finds the website useful, immersive, and engaging. It is highly intuitive based on the expectations of the users and uses this knowledge of user expectations to ensure an excellent user experience. Web development, on the other hand, involves building and maintaining a website with the help of coding systems so that the website functions smoothly with no glitches.</p>

        <h2 id="what_is_responsive_web_design">What is Responsive Web Design?</h2>
        <p>Responsive web design is a technique used to make certain changes to a website such that it adapts to the screen size and orientation of different devices. A website designed for bigger screens does not fit small screens seamlessly, which causes inconvenience for viewers. Therefore, responsive web design has become a very important factor that influences user experience in recent times, as people use their smartphones and tablets to browse through websites.</p>
